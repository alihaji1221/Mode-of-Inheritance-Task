DSC2,"DSC2-related ARVC is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. null alleles, trafficking defects, impaired proteolytic processing, absence of or impaired protein-protein interactions) (PMID: 31028357; 23911551; NBK1131). Loss of function is the likely disease mechanism. ClinGen found there was some evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3036.  Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance is the most common mode of transmission (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have also been described in association with ARVC with or without cutaneous features (PMID: 26310507; 23863954; 24793512; 24070718; 34400560). In some cases, these appear to reflect autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID 24793512; 23863954, 33831308). Instances of digenic inheritance have been identified with DSC2 variants along with other desmosomal gene pathogenic variants (PMID: 24070718). A number of DSC2 variants have been reported in the literature including nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense and inframe insertions and deletions (NBK1131; 17033975; 17963498; 17186466; 20031616; 19863551; 31402444). DSC2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560).",AD/AR
DSG2,"DSG2-related ARVC is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms.  Much of the underlying pathogenesis of DSG2 pathogenic variants is still unknown; it is believed that loss of DSG2 compromises cell-to-cell adhesion between cardiomyocytes (PMID:26085008; NBK1131). There is also work revealing that desmosomal variants can reduce canonical Wnt signaling and activating Wnt with a GSK3B inhibitor can block disease pathogenesis (PMID 16823493; 27170944). The usual mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant characterized by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). Compound heterozygous and homozygous variants have been described. In some families, heterozygous carriers of these variants were not affected suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance (PMID: 33917638; 34400560; 24070718; 33831308; 30454721). Patients with >1 variant appear to have a more severe phenotype (PMID: 25616645; PMID: 30790397).  The majority of DSG2 variants are rare missense variants with unknown significance/unknown mechanism of pathogenicity. In addition, nonsense, frameshift, insertions, deletions, and splice site variants have all been described (PMID: 16505173; NBK1131; 30790397; 27532257; 33917638).  DSG2-related ARVC appears to be characterised by an increased risk of biventricular involvement and heart failure when compared to PKP2-related ARVC (PMID: 34400560; 30790397).",AD/AR
DSP,"DSP-related ARVC is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is loss of function via haploinsufficiency, dominant negative or both (PMID 32372669; 23137101; 16917092; NBK1131).
DSP-related ARVC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner characterized by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 21636032; 33831308). However, DSP is associated with multiple phenotypes which are heterogeneous and overlapping (including DCM, DCM with cutaneous features, ARVC, and Carvajal syndrome) and autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. There does not appear to be distinct mechanisms leading to different phenotypes https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:3052. The initial variant description in DSP was in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC. In 2000 three families from Ecuador were found to be homozygous for the variant 7901delG in DSP which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region (PMID 11063735). Since then both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance have been described in Carvajal syndrome (PMID: 27761164; 20940358; 22795705; 26604139; 23137101). This was followed by the description of a heterozygous variant in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC with co-segregation of the variant with disease. There have been reports of digenic inheritance with other desmosomal pathogenic variants. In a retrospective multicentre study, curly hair and/or thick skin on the palms or soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) was commonly present in DSP patients (54/98, 55%) but not in PKP2 patients (1/46, 2%) (PMID: 32372669). Maruthappu et al 2019 also describe 38 patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy who were carriers of a dominant loss-of-function (nonsense or frameshift) variants in DSP. Nearly all were found to have curly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma. However, there was one family described where the majority did not demonstrate a curly hair/cutaneous phenotype. The variant in this family was located in a fragment (c.3585â5379, (p.1195â1793)) only included in isoform 1 of DSP (it has previously been shown that isoform 2 is the major isoform regulating keratinocyte adhesion (PMID: 30382575). Both truncating (stop gained, frame shift, splice site) and non-truncating variants in DSP have been reported in the literature associated with ARVC (PMID 31319917; 20716751; 23810894; 24503780; 27532257; 31514951; 27761164; 21636032; 32808748). Pathogenic truncating variants are more common. Grondin et al 2020 re-evaluated reported missense variants and found an enrichment localizing to the spectrin repeat domain (SRD) in cases vs gnomAD. A similar hot spot location (amino acid residues 250-604) was reported by Kapplinger et al in 2011 (PMID: 32808748; 21636032). Smith E et al 2020 report that DSP variants are associated with a distinct type of cardiomyopathy with a high prevalence of LV inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction, and DSP cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis for myocarditis and sarcoidosis (PMID: 32372669).

PKP2,"PKP2 pathogenic variants cause ARVC through decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. PKP2 encodes plakophilin-2 which is a protein of the desmosome and provides structural and functional integrity to adjacent cells. The disease mechanism in ARVC is loss of function (LoF). Rasmussen et al showed that truncating variants in PKP2 resulted in PKP2 transcript and protein levels reduced to â50% (PMID: 24704780). Cerrone et al showed that loss of PKP2 in adult myocytes was sufficient to generate an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of right ventricle predominance in mice (PMID: 28740174). PKP2 is the major causative gene for ARVC and accounts for 34%-74% of cases (PMID: 20301310). Inheritance is predominantly autosomal dominant characterised by variable expression and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 34120153; 21636032; 17010805). Both recessive and digenic inheritance (with one pathogenic variant in PKP2 and a second in another desmosomal gene) have been reported (including a recessive cryptic splice variant PMID 17041889) and appear to confer a more severe phenotype (PMID: 30830208; 25616645; 24070718; NBK1131). The expert panel noted instances where PKP2 LoF variants on both alleles had resulted in neonatal lethality. There are over 250 PKP2 variants listed in ClinVar for ARVC (nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense, deletions, duplications, and complex rearrangements (PMID: 30619891; 25616645; 21636032; 34120153). Dries et al report that PKP2 truncating variants explain a large proportion of ARVC cases but there is no clear relationship between their transcript position and their likelihood of disease association (PMID: 30619891). Although missense variants are associated with disease and validated with functional studies (PMID 22781308), their mechanism and overall impact in ARVC is not completely understood. The majority of missense variants in ClinVar are classified as variants of uncertain significance.",AD/AR
JUP,"JUP-related Naxos disease (ARVC, woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma) is due to altered gene product sequence causing loss of function of JUP (PMID: 25705887; 21673311; 11691526; 10902626). JUP encodes the protein plakoglobin. Kaplan et al found that in 4 Naxos patients, Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was significantly reduced and mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions (PMID:15851108). Inheritance is autosomal recessive.  The initial nine patients described ranged in age from 7 to 41 years. Since then, more patients have been discovered carrying the disease with an estimate of 1:1000 in the population of the Greek islands. The disease has also been diagnosed in other countries (PMID: 32966140). A homozygous 2bp deletion in plakoglobin (JUP), c.2157delTG, causing a frameshift and premature termination of the protein and expression of a truncated plakoglobin lacking 56 residues from the C terminus was described in 2000 (PMID:10902626). The truncated protein was identified on western blot.  In 2017, a homozygous missense variant was described in 7 unrelated French-Canadian individuals. All had typical hair and skin findings; 4/7 had ARVC presenting after 28 years (PMID: 28098346). The effect of this variant in the heterozygous state was not investigated. Two siblings of consanguineous parents were found to have a homozygous 3bp deletion in JUP c.901903delGAG (p.Glu301del). Both had woolly hair and skin findings, only the older sister had ARVC and neither had palmoplantar keratoderma (PMID: 28098346). In OMIM there have been reports of other types of homozygous variants (nonsense, splice, missense) in JUP causing overlapping phenotypes and segregating with disease. Data on biallelic LoF variants are sparse.  In mice, generation of a null mutation of the plakoglobin gene by homologous recombination results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 8954745; 8858175). There are 2 reports in humans who had skin features but no obvious cardiomyopathy (PMID: 20130592; 21320868). In one, JUP expression in the skin was absent. Cardiac JUP expression was not directly measured to establish the consequence in the heart â it is not known whether variant allele was expressed, degraded, or rescued by alternate splicing. To note dominant pathogenic variants in JUP have also been rarely described in association with ARVC. Asimaki et al reported a dominant variant in JUP in a German family with ARVC and no obvious cutaneous abnormalities (PMID: 17924338). Other studies have identified heterozygous missense variants however their pathogenicity is still debated (PMID 25820315; 20031617; 31402444).",AD/AR
CALM1,"The disease mechanism in CALM1-related CPVT is likely a dominant negative effect caused by altered gene product sequence which reduces the calcium dependent inactivation of the calcium channel CaV1.2, resulting in increased inward calcium channel current (ICaL) and repolarization delay. The three CALM genes encode an identical 149aa protein, calmodulin. The CALM1 gene is located on chromosome 14, CALM2 on chromosome 2 and CALM3 on chromosome 19. Calmodulin protein is involved in many calcium-dependent intracellular processes.  All three CALM genes have been classified as Definitive for LQTS and Moderate for CPVT, certain variants are only associated with one or other phenotype, whereas others are associated with a mixed or variable phenotypes.   All variants with evidence of pathogenicity identified in the CALM genes are missense: at least 35 distinct missense variants have been identified and reported in the International Calmodulinopathy Registry including 11 (31%) in CALM1, 16 (46%) in CALM2, and 8 (23%) in CALM3. The majority of variants across the CALM genes affect amino acid residues in the EF-hand Ca2+ binding loop III and IV. Some variants have additional evidence in that the same substitution has been seen in paralogous CALM genes, or that the same substitution has been seen in a related phenotype (LQT). Most variants are unique, but 9 were present in more than one index case and among these, three (p.Asn98Ser, p.Asp130Gly, and p.Phe142Leu, identified in 10, 5, and 4 families, respectively.) appear to be recurrent. While p.Asp130Gly and p.Phe142Leu have always been reported as associated with the LQTS phenotype, the p.Asn98Ser has phenotypic variability, including LQTS, CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden death. The majority of CALM variants are de novo.  Pathogenic variants in the CALM genes have been associated with: presentation in infancy or early childhood (up to 5 years); marked sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block and QT prolongation; and, predominantly with CALM1 variants, a mild-to-severe neurological impairment, including seizures, development delay, motor and/or cognitive disability.  The phenotype most frequently shown by patients with CALM variants is LQTS, but some patients display other phenotypes including CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden unexplained death. Some variants have been associated with both LQTS and CPVT, however Crotti et al (PMID: 31170290) report that ""despite the relatively small numbers of cases, a significant association (Pâ=â0.001) was observed between location of mutation and phenotype (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Indeed, a pathogenic variant in EF-hand IV Ca2+ binding loop was found in the majority (17/32, 53%) of CALM-LQTS index cases but in only one of the nine CALM-CPVTs (11%). Conversely, variants identified in CALM-CPVT index cases were mostly located either in EF-hand III (nâ=â5, 56%), or in the inter-EF hand I-II linker (nâ=â3, 33%).""   For the ClinGen CPVT curation, CALM1 scored in the moderate range based on two reported variants in patients with CPVT or mixed CPVT/LQT phenotypes (p.Asn54Ile and p.Asn98Ser) and associated functional data. However, due to the unique characteristics of the calmodulin genes and their gene-disease associations, it was agreed by the expert panel to include them in this curation. The reasons were: 1) all three genes have already been established as disease-causing for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome (LQTS), 2) there are multiple examples of patients presenting with a phenotype indistinguishable from CPVT for each, either de novo or supported by functional evidence and 3) the genes encode for identical proteins, are all expressed in the heart and equivalent de novo variants in the three genes have been shown to lead to similar phenotypes, highlighting the functional equivalence of these genes.",AD

SCN5A,"SCN5A-related Brugada syndrome is caused by decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. decreased expression of cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5 in the sarcolemma, expression of non-functional channels, or altered gating properties leading to a decreased INa sodium current (e.g., delayed activation or earlier or faster inactivation)) (PMID: 29798782). The disease mechanism is loss of function.   To date, SCN5A is the only gene classified as having definitive evidence as a cause of monogenic Brugada syndrome (BrS) by ClinGen (PMID: 29959160). SCN5A pathogenic variants are identified in approx. 20- 30% of cases of European ancestry (PMID: 30139433; PMID 33164571). This contribution may differ in other populations.  SCN5A-related Brugada syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance (PMID 9521325; 11748104; 25905440; 20031634; 33164571; NBK1517). Hundreds of variants, both truncating and non-truncating, have been described in association with Brugada syndrome. Kapplinger et al 2010 (PMID: 20129283) identified 293 distinct variants in SCN5A: 193 missense, 32 nonsense, 38 frameshift, 21 splice-site, and 9 inframe deletions/insertions. More recently Walsh et al 2020 (PMID: 32893267) found that non truncating variants were highly enriched in European cases in the SCN5A transmembrane regions. Gain of function variants are associated with Long QT syndrome. Although loss of function appears to be the accepted mechanism in Brugada syndrome the SCN5A genotype/phenotype association is still not completely understood. Uncommonly, a single variant can cause both loss of peak current and gain of late current and can lead to a mixed phenotype of LQTS and BrS (PMID: 29806494). ",AD
CASQ2,"CASQ2 is an established gene for autosomal recessive CPVT (the second most common genetic cause of the disease, responsible for up to 5% of cases). Recent reports have also associated monoallelic or heterozygous CASQ2 variants with CPVT.  Although the evidence for this association is not definitive, available data suggests that disease is likely due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. The main evidence for autosomal dominant CASQ2 association comes from an international multi-centre study describing CPVT patients with CASQ2 variants (Ng et al, 2020, PMID:32693635). This study included 12 probands with heterozygous variants in CASQ2, as well as an assessment of heterozygous relatives of probands with homozygous/compound heterozygous CASQ2 variants (8/37 of these heterozygous relatives had a positive CPVT phenotype). While this study provides a substantive body of evidence to support autosomal dominant CASQ2 association with CPVT, the data should be cautiously interpreted. The multi-centre nature of the study precluded standardised phenotyping of the probands and relatives and therefore not every phenotype-positive individual may have a definitive diagnosis of CPVT. Additionally, several of the variants described have a gnomAD population minor allele frequency that is incompatible with being a penetrant autosomal dominant variant for a disease with the prevalence of CPVT (>1x10-5). The variants also included presumed nonsense mediated decay-escaping C-terminal truncating variants and a splice region variant without a proven effect on splicing. In contrast to 97% penetrance for homozygous/compound heterozygous individuals, penetrance for heterozygotes was only 33% although it is expected that the population level penetrance of CASQ2 heterozygous variants will be lower still. Further support for the pathogenicity of heterozygous CASQ2 variants comes from a study that described the heterozygous p.Lys180Arg variant segregating with disease in a family (the published LOD score was 3.0 although there were only five meioses between genotype and phenotype positive individuals) (Gray et al, 2016, PMID:27157848).",AD/AR
CASQ2,"CASQ2 is an established gene for autosomal recessive CPVT (the second most common genetic cause of the disease, responsible for up to 5% of cases); disease is due to absent gene product level or altered gene product sequence. For the ClinGen curation, the maximum points were achieved with only a small subset of initial genetic and experimental reports leading to a definitive classification. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in CASQ2 (both homozygous and compound heterozygous) have been reported in numerous CPVT probands, including frameshift, nonsense and splice donor/acceptor variants, as well as other splice region variants with verified effects on splicing, and missense variants with verified loss-of-function effects.",AR
BAG3,"Pathogenic variants in BAG3 cause an estimated 2-4% of familial DCM due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. This likely leads to loss of function causing several pathological effects on cardiomyocytes including direct destabilization of the Z-disc, impaired protein homeostasis leading to proteotoxicity and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Truncating variants are responsible for most BAG3-related DCM cases, the majority of which are nonsense and frameshift, and include several single, multi-exon, and whole gene deletions. ClinGen have concluded there is good evidence for haploinsufficiency. There is not yet evidence for dominant-negative effects. There is no apparent enrichment for non-truncating mutations in any specific domain, and it should be noted that different missense variants in similar domains can lead to different phenotypes (e.g., p.Pro209Leu leading to myofibrillar myopathy, and p.Arg218Trp leading to DCM). BAG3-related DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, characterised by incomplete penetrance.",AD
DES,"Pathogenic variants in DES cause DCM due to altered gene product sequence. Only missense variants in DES have been confidently reported as pathogenic in DCM. There are no reports of truncating variants; DES is yet to undergo ClinGen Dosage Haploinsufficiency investigations. DES has a pLI of 0.01 in gnomAD (o/e = 0.33 (0.19 - 0.6)).  There is some indication that truncating variants in DES are associated with myofibrillar myopathy rather than DCM. There is a report of a splice site variant in a DCM case, however, it causes exon 3 skipping to produce an inframe transcript (PMID: 17626518). DES-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is generally highly penetrant. DES missense variants account for a very small proportion (estimated 2%) of genetically-explained DCM (PMID: 17325244).",AD
FLNC,"Pathogenic variants in FLNC account for approximately 2-4% of familial DCM due to decreased gene product level. The mechanism is likely loss of function, leading to Z-disc disarray and weakened cell-cell adhesion, promoting arrhythmogenesis and fibrosis. Truncating variants (stop-gained, frameshift and splicing) are responsible for almost all reported cases of FLNC-related DCM to date. It is possible that some loss-of-function missense variants could cause DCM and experts commented on their experience of families with missense variants segregating with disease. However, there is limited evidence for this. Xiao et al 2020 report an infant girl presenting with DCM and a paternally inherited missense variant, p.Arg441Ile in FLNC identified on exome sequencing. No functional studies were carried out (PMID: 32154132).  The FLNC-related DCM phenotype is frequently arrhythmogenic, characterized by a high burden of ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial fibrosis. FLNC-related DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, penetrance in close relatives of an affected proband is generally high, although not complete, with mean age of onset in the late 4th or early 5th decade, +/- 10-15 years.

LMNA,"Pathogenic variants in LMNA cause DCM due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence, likely due to a variety of mechanisms. Missense variants are more prevalent, and are responsible for a larger proportion of DCM cases, but truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice variants) are also associated with disease, most probably through loss of function mechanisms. LMNA has a ClinGen Dosage sensitivity score of 2, indicating there is some evidence for dosage pathogenicity. Non-missense variants are reported to convey a higher risk of life-threatening arrhythmia (31155932). LMNA-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is generally a highly penetrant and aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotype with high rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. LMNA missense and truncating variants account for ~5-8% of genetic DCM. Of note LMNA is also associated with several other conditions (the laminopathies) including muscular dystrophies and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Some of these conditions are autosomal recessive and some dominant. There is evidence of clustering of variants to specific regions of the gene. However, DCM causing variants have been recorded across the gene and are so far all reported with dominant inheritance. ",AD/AR
MYH7,"MYH7 encodes the Î²-myosin heavy chain, part of the sarcomere which plays a major role in cardiac muscle contraction.  Pathogenic variants in MYH7 cause DCM due to altered gene product sequence primarily due to decrease in sarcomere force generation. Dominant-negative missense variants resulting in an altered protein with reduced function are responsible for most MYH7-associated DCM cases, and a small number of inframe indels have also been reported associated with disease. The likely disease mechanism is a reduction in the passive stiffness of myofibrils (PMID: 29093449) and deficit in force generation and force-holding capacity (PMID: 29666183). There is no good evidence that loss of function is a disease mechanism (e.g. PMID: 31983221), and MYH7 is not known to be haploinsufficient. MYH7-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease has incomplete penetrance, age-related onset, and variable expressivity. Pathogenic MYH7 variants are likely to account for approximately 5-6% of familial DCM cases.  There is evidence that biallelic variants can have an additive effect resulting in more severe cardiomyopathic phenotypes.",AD
PLN,"Pathogenic variants in PLN cause cardiomyopathy by decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. Inheritance is typically autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance but biallelic variants have been described and appear to confer an earlier onset and more severe phenotype (PMID: 12639993). PLN is encoded by one coding exon (52 amino acids). Schmitt et al described a missense variant (p.Arg9Cys) in a patient with DCM. The variant segregated with disease in the family; transgenic mice developed biventricular dilatation (PMID 12610310). A stop gained variant and inframe deletion have also been described (PMID: 12639993; PMID 16432188). There are 6 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported on ClinVar: 1 missense, 2 stop gained, 2 frameshift and a large deletion all associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. In the Netherlands there is a founder mutation p.Arg14del. Up to 10â15% of both dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients are reported to be caused by PLN-R14del. (PMID: 33020536). ClinGen found no difference in the molecular mechanism(s) underlying PLN-related DCM and HCM and observed that inter and intrafamilial variability in phenotype had been reported. Haghighi et al describe the same variant (p.Leu39X) in a family causing severe DCM in the homozygous state and both DCM and HCM phenotypes in the heterozygous state (PMID: 12639993). This variant has also been reported in other HCM families (PMID: 21167350). As a result, ClinGen curated PLN for an association with intrinsic cardiomyopathy and did not separately evaluate the evidence for the role in hypertrophic vs dilated phenotypes. PLN is definitively associated with cardiomyopathy and the majority of variants reported appear to be associated with DCM. Experts commented that further investigation into PLN and HCM and the variant classes associated needs to be undertaken.",AD
RBM20,"Pathogenic variants in RBM20 cause DCM due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence due to a variety of mechanisms including altered splicing of targets. A dominant negative effect causing disrupted RNA binding is also a possible/likely mechanism.
Missense variants are responsible for the majority of DCM cases although a small number of truncating variants (nonsense) have been reported. Of note, there are multiple ClinVar entries of truncating variants associated with DCM reported by diagnostic laboratories, comparing to the very low number of truncating variants detected in gnomAD. Loss of function via truncating variants is not absolutely established, but highly likely. RBM20-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is often an aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotype with high rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Pathogenic RBM20 variants are likely to account for approximately 1.5-3% of familial DCM cases. There is a pathogenic variant hotspot in exon 9 (RS motif, amino acids 634-638).",AD
TNNC1,"Pathogenic variants in TNNC1 are a rare (<1%) cause of familial DCM due to altered gene product sequence. This leads to a likely âpoison peptideâ dominant negative effect, causing alteration of troponin interactions, and altered (decreased) calcium binding of myofilaments and resulting in decreased force production. Missense variants are responsible for all reported cases of TNNC1-related DCM, with no evidence that truncating variants are causative of disease. There is no apparent enrichment for non-truncating mutations in any specific domain, although exon 1-3 show regional constraint (gnomAD database). TNNC1-related DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance observed in families. There is currently insufficient evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance, although there are some reports of early onset DCM and other cardiomyopathy associated with compound heterozygosity for TNNC1 variants (PMID: 27604170).",AD/AR
TNNT2,"Pathogenic variants in TNNT2 cause DCM due to altered gene product sequence. Only missense variants have confidently been reported as pathogenic in TNNT2 DCM cases. There are no reports of truncating variants and TNNT2 has a ClinGen Dosage haploinsufficiency score of 0, and a PLi of 0 in gnomAD (19.6 expected and 20 observed). TNNT2-related DCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and disease is often an aggressive arrhythmogenic phenotype with high rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. TNNT2 missense mutations account for 3% of genetic DCM (PMID:27532257). TNNT2 variants are associated with an early-onset and more severe form of DCM. Of note pathogenic variants in TNNT2 are also associated hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies.",AD
TTN,"Pathogenic variants in TTN cause an estimated 15-20% of familial DCM due to decreased gene product level and altered gene product sequence. The likely disease mechanism is loss of function however, it is unclear whether this is due to haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect, and it is likely that both mechanisms contribute. It is likely that the reduced function has a direct effect on the sarcomere, leading to impaired contractility.  Truncating variants, specifically in exons constitutively expressed in cardiac tissue (PSI >0.9) see (PMID: 25589632; 27869827; 32160020), are responsible for the vast majority of TTN-related DCM cases. Missense variants are difficult to interpret, and generally not classified as disease-causing, although there are reports of at least three missense variants with evidence of pathogenicity.  
TTN missense variants with segregation evidence: p.Trp976Arg (PMID: 11788824) p.Ala178Asp (PMID: 27625337) p.Cys3575Ser (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.282913v1.full.pdf) â note not yet peer reviewed
TTN-related DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and displays incomplete and age-related onset. TTN truncating variants are present in ~1% of the general population, although these variants are more likely to reside in isoforms with lower functional expression in cardiac tissue.",AD
ACTC1,"ACTC1 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is not definitively known but may involve impact on sarcomere force generation. There is currently little evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. There is limited information regarding penetrance. The initial missense variant identified by Mogensen et al was reported to be highly penetrant in family members but with a variable age of onset and severity (PMID:10330430). ACTC1 variants account for <3-5% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 20031618).  Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found. One inframe deletion (a deletion of a single amino acid, Phe92del) has been reported in association with HCM (PMID: 20031618). This variant is classified as likely pathogenic on ClinVar. Liu et al suggest it may act to change the local structure and arrangement of amino acids in the actomyosin binding site (PMID: 28972856). Large deletions or duplications have not been described.",AD
MYBPC3,"MYBPC3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence either leading to a reduction in MyBP-C content in the sarcomere or altered function. The disease mechanism is loss of function; There is evidence of haploinsufficiency (PMID 31877118; 22057632; 32841044). Variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 collectively account for up to 50% of all clinically recognised cases of HCM and constitute at least 75% of probands where a variant is identified (PMID: 28007147; NBK1768). Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, typified by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.  Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have been reported and can lead to severe, early onset phenotypes (PMID: 26573135; 25611685; PMID: 18467358; PMID: 17937428).  The majority of variants are heterozygous frameshift, nonsense, or splice site variants that result in premature termination codons (PMID: 25611685; 31877118). Missense and inframe indels are also frequently reported and a subset have been shown to cause loss of function through failure of myofilament incorporation and rapid degradation, further supporting haploinsufficiency as a mechanism (PMID 32841044). Variants in MYBPC3 affecting canonical splice site dinucleotides are a well-characterised cause of HCM.  Furthermore, recent work has identified more deeply intronic variants associated with disease (https://doi.org/10.3390/cardiogenetics11020009; PMID: 32396390). There are 39 pathogenic/likely pathogenic MYBPC3 intronic variants submitted on ClinVar. The common intronic deletion, MYBPC3Î25, detected in 4% to 8% of South Asian populations, is associated with cardiomyopathy as a risk allele (PMID: 19151713). Although there is significant genetic and allelic heterogeneity in HCM, there are also several MYBPC3 founder variants (PMID: 28912181; 27532257).",AD
MYL2,"MYL2pathogenic variants cause autosomal HCM through altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is not definitively known but may involve destabilization of the interacting heads motif (PMID: 28606303). There is currently insufficient evidence to support haploinsufficiency (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:7583). MYL2variants account for <3% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 32731933). Inheritance is typically autosomal dominant. There is limited information regarding penetrance. Homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have been described in association with a lethal myosinopathy (PMID 23365102). A study reported a homozygous frameshift variant causing infantile onset HCM. Heterozygous parents were unaffected. The authors suggest a molecular mechanism by which loss-of-function variants in MYL2are recessive while missense variants are dominant in HCM. Several loss-of-function variants are reported in gnomAD suggesting MYL2is not intolerant to LoF variants. (PMID: 32453731).
The majority of variants reported are missense (PMID 8673105; PMID 9535554; PMID 12404107.)  On ClinVar, nearly all pathogenic variants are missense. There is one frameshift variant associated only with cardiomyopathy, not HCM specifically and a deletion encompassing exon 7 expected to result in a truncated protein - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/417460/. Walsh et al found the MYL2gene to be significantly enriched for non-truncating variants, odds ratio 9.1 (6.2-13.3) (PMID: 30696458).",AD/AR
MYL3,"MYL3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is not definitively known but may involve impairing protein-protein interaction with components of the sarcomere and destabilizing the interacting heads motif (PMID: 30275503; PMID: 28606303). There is currently no evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:7584). MYL3 variants account for <3% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 20031618; PMID: 28369730). Inheritance is primarily autosomal dominant. There is limited information regarding penetrance given small numbers of variants identified. In a large family where a missense variant was identified (p. Arg94His), penetrance was estimated at 88% (PMID: 26443374). Osborn et al 2021 (PMID: 33288880) report a homozygous missense variant in a large family with HCM and sudden cardiac death. Heterozygous carriers were unaffected. Another biallelic variant was also described by Olson et al in 2002 (E143K) (PMID: 12021217), however this variant has also been associated with HCM variably in the heterozygous state. Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found (PMID 8673105; 20031618; 25611685). There are reports on ClinVar of frameshift and splice site variants, but these are classified as uncertain significance or conflicting. There is currently insufficient evidence to support loss of function as a mechanism.  Walsh et al reported a cluster of non-truncating MYL3 variants in HCM at amino acid residues 143-180 (PMID: 30696458).",AD
TNNI3,"TNNI3 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is not definitively known but a review by Tardif et al reported functional studies on missense variants that found an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilament activation (PMID: 21415410). ClinGen also conclude that âmissense mutations have [been] shown to affect Ca2+ binding to myofilaments containing the mutant TNNI3 (PMIDs: 16531415 and 22675533) or result in an increased myofilament response to Ca2+ (PMID: 11735257).â https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:11947. TNNI3 variants account for approx. 3-5% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 15607392). Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterised by incomplete penetrance (PMID 26440512; 15607392; 9241277). Lorenzini et al found that subjects with TNNI3 variants had a lower penetrance than variants in MYBPC3, MYH7, and TNNT2 (PMID: 32731933). Experts commented that variants seen in TNNI3 in severe/early onset disease were more likely to be de novo in origin. Maron et al 2012 describe 4 HCM probands with both pathogenic variants in TNNI3 and MYBPC3 (PMID 21839045). In addition, 2 siblings have been reported with homozygous TNNI3 missense variants (Arg162Trp) and severe myocardial hypertrophy. Parents of the affected children are consanguineous and along with other family members harbouring the same variant in the heterozygous state, were unaffected (PMID 23270746). Multiple disease-causing sarcomeric variants appear to be associated with more severe disease. There is not enough evidence to suggest biallelic variants in TNNI3 have a distinct mechanism compared to monoallelic variants. Of note both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance have been reported in TNNI3-related DCM (PMID: 26440512). Heterozygous missense variants are the major type of pathogenic variants found. There are also reports of inframe deletions. In a systematic review, Mogensen et al reported 91% of all variants were missense variants. Six variants (Arg141Gln, Arg145Trp, Arg157Val, Arg162Gln, Ser166Phe, and Lys183Del) appeared with a particularly high frequency and were identified in 116 of the 256 probands (45%) (PMID 26440512). There are reports on ClinVar of frameshift, splice site variants and nonsense variants but these are either classified as uncertain significance/conflicting, not associated with HCM specifically or have no functional evidence to demonstrate loss of function as a mechanism. ClinGen have concluded that there is currently limited evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism. 
Mogensen et al found that 85% of variants were identified in exons 7 and 8 (amino acid residues 125 â 210). (PMID 26440512). Similarly, Walsh et al detected a cluster of non-truncating TNNI3 variants in HCM at amino acid residues 141â209 (PMID: 30696458).",AD/AR
TPM1,"TPM1 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. TPM1 encodes alpha-tropomyosin which acts to place the troponin complex on cardiac actin. The mechanism is through altered function rather than haploinsufficiency â Bottinelli et al examined the Asp175Asn variant from 2 HCM patients and found equal expression of wild type and mutant alpha-tropomyosin proteins (PMID 9440709). Gupte et al concluded that âTPM1 mutations cause differences in protein stability, actin binding, and Tn conformation. All of these differences could converge to change the Ca2+ dependence of myosin activityâ (PMID: 25548289). TPM1 variants account for <3% of HCM cases (NBK1768; PMID: 7898523; 12860912). Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterised by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 32731933).  There are reports of homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in TPM1. (PMID: 33642254; PMID: 32744700). A homozygous missense variant, (p.Gly3Arg), in exon 1 of TPM1 was identified in triplets (two had HCM and one patent ductus arteriosus). The parents were heterozygous for the variant and unaffected clinically and on echocardiogram (PMID: 32744700). Pathogenic variants are nearly always heterozygous missense variants. There is one de novo inframe deletion (6bp, 2 amino acids) associated with HCM classified as likely pathogenic on ClinVar, no additional details are given.  Redwood and Robinson reviewed TPM1 variants in 2013 and reported âat least 15 described in the current literature (Table1). Most of these mutations are unique and have been reported in only a single family or individualâ¦Each mutation is missense causing a single amino acid substitution, and no truncation or nonsense mutations have been reported.â (PMID 24005378). Walsh et al found that in HCM non-truncating variants across the whole TPM1 gene showed a high probability of pathogenicity. (PMID: 30696458)",AD
KCNH2,"KCNH2-related LQTS is due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. The disease mechanism is loss of function due to a variety of mechanisms including disruption of synthesis of channel subunits, reduction in intracellular transport or trafficking, defects in ion permeation or channel gating. Both haploinsufficiency and a dominant negative effect are proposed mechanisms causing loss of function of KCNH2. About 60% of LQT2 mutations are missense variants, the remaining 40% are nonsense, frameshift, insertions, deletions, duplications (intragenic tandem duplication), or involve a splice site.  KCNH2 variants account for approximately 30% of LQTS cases (PMID: 24932360). Walsh et al showed that non truncating variants in KCNH2 are enriched in ion channel transmembrane regions and specific N-terminus and C-terminus domains and have >95% probability of pathogenicity (PMID: 32893267). Shimizu et al report correlations between specific variant types and location and clinical phenotype (PMID: 19926013). Patients with missense variants in the transmembrane pore region have significantly higher cardiac event rates than those with missense variants in either N-terminus, transmembrane non-pore, or C-terminus regions.  It has been noted that approximately 10% of genotype positive LQT patients have more than 1 pathogenic variant in >=1 gene. Biallelic pathogenic variants or digenic pathogenic variants appear to be generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc interval and a higher incidence of cardiac events.",AD
KCNQ1,"Pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 cause LQTS due to decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. This leads to loss of function due to a variety of mechanisms including defects in ion permeation, channel gating and trafficking. KCNQ1 variants account for approx. 30%-45% of LQTS cases (PMID: 22456477; PMID: 21787999; PMID: 27262388; PMID: 29504689). KCNQ1-related LQTS is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait characterised by incomplete penetrance. Rarely biallelic KCNQ1 variants can cause autosomal recessive LQTS or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) (severe cardiac phenotype and sensorineural hearing loss). JLNS results when there is complete absence of IKs (slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel/current) (PMID: 23591039). It has been noted that approximately 10% of genotype positive LQT patients have more than 1 pathogenic variant in >=1 LQTS-related gene (PMID: 15840476; PMID: 19716085). Biallelic disease appears to be more penetrant with a more severe phenotype. Missense variants are responsible for the majority of KCNQ1-related LQTS cases although truncating variants including nonsense, frameshift, splice site and structural variants (multi exon deletions and a multi exon duplication (inframe tandem repeat of exons 3-6, leading to duplication of the second to fifth transmembrane domains of the channel)) are also reported (PMID: 19716085; PMID: 18774102; PMID: 25174857).  ClinGen have concluded there is sufficient evidence for haploinsufficiency. Variants conferring a dominant negative effect have also been described. Moss et al (PMID: 17470695) reported that dominant-negative variants are associated with a more severe phenotype than variants conferring haploinsufficiency. Phenotypes can differ according to regionality with some regions associated with more malignant phenotypes e.g. C-loop variants are associated with higher risk of sudden cardiac death (PMID: 22456477). In addition, there are gene regions where there is a high confidence for pathogenicity e.g. transmembrane regions and C-terminus domains (PMID: 32893267; PMID: 19841300).

ALPK3,"
ALPK3 pathogenic variants cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through decreased gene product level or altered gene product sequence. 
Biallelic ALPK3 variants were first associated with a rare recessive form of cardiomyopathy by Almomani et al in 2016 (PMID:26846950), with several other reports since (PMID:27106955; PMID: 31074094; PMID: 32480058). Patients display variable phenotypes but often present at birth or early childhood (at least 4 patients have presented in utero) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that progressed to a HCM phenotype over time. Extra-cardiac features including musculoskeletal and craniofacial abnormalities are also commonly observed in these cases (PMID: 32480058; PMID: 34263911). Herkert et al 2020 reviewed the variants and phenotype in 19 paediatric patients with biallelic ALPK3 variants (including 9 previously published cases) and identified 11 loss-of-function (LoF) variants (including nonsense, frameshift and intronic variants with predicted severe effect on splicing), seven compound LoF and deleterious missense variants, and one homozygous deleterious missense variant, c.5155G>C, p.(Ala1719Pro) (PMID: 32480058). The clinical manifestations associated with the missense variants were similar to those associated with other damaging ALPK3 variants.  To note heterozygous LoF ALPK3 variants have also been reported and are enriched in adults with cardiomyopathy (PMID: 34263907; PMID: 32480058; PMID: 33191771). Haploinsufficiency is the proposed mechanism. Herkert et al found notable differences between the clinical features associated with monoallelic and biallelic ALPK3 cardiomyopathy, including absence or undetected extracardiac phenotypes. âWhether these differences reflect graded dose-responses to ALPK3 deficits or distinct mechanisms by which monoallelic or biallelic variants cause disease remains unknown.â (PMID: 32480058).  There does not appear to be a distinct mechanism between monoallelic and biallelic variants. The disease mechanism is loss of function of ALPK3 likely due to creation of premature stop codons, leading to nonsense-mediated decay or truncated proteins with partial or complete removal of the kinase domain (PMID:26846950; 27106955; 32480058; 21441111). Herkert et al predicted that missense variants could result in a conformational change that affects protein folding or flexibility, protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction, or the activity of the alpha-kinase domain (PMID: 32480058).",AR
DES,"DES-related myofibrillar myopathy is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Penetrance is incomplete with age-related onset, but simplex cases have often been found to be due to de novo heterozygous variants rather than recessive variants. Over 100 different variants have been reported, including missense variants, in-frame indels, and splice-site variants leading to exon skipping. There is evidence for a possible genotype-phenotype correlation for heterozygous DES variants, with variants located in specific domains more likely to cause either a neurological or cardiac phenotype. There is a wide range of cardiac phenotypes associated with DES, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and left-ventricular non-compaction. Cardiac involvement can be the presenting feature, even without recognised syndromic features, fulfilling a clinical diagnosis of HCM. The mechanism of autosomal dominant disease is likely a dominant-negative effect of protein-altering variants leading to abnormal intermediate filament aggregation.
The autosomal recessive phenotype has been associated with an earlier age of onset, and has been linked with combinations of protein-altering variants and/or null variants. It has been suggested that biallelic loss of function leads to the autosomal recessive phenotype, indicating a distinct mechanism of disease to the dominant phenotype. The heterozygous parents of patients with the recessive phenotype are reported as being clinically unaffected, suggesting that heterozygous loss of function is tolerated.",AD/AR
FHL1,"FHL1-related Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is inherited as an X-linked condition. Carrier females are usually unaffected, but some exhibit a cardiac and/or skeletal muscle phenotype. The precise mechanism is unclear, but may be mediated by reduced function or dominant-negative effects of altered FHL1, associated with frameshift/truncating variants predicted to escape NMD, missense variants, or loss of the native stop codon. FHL1 pathogenic variants are responsible for a minority of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy cases (~1.2% according to GeneReviews). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is more typical of FHL1-related Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, while LMNA and EMD Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy are more commonly associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. There are reports of FHL1 variants causing isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, without skeletal myopathy.",AD
PRKAG2,"PRKAG2 pathogenic variants cause disease through altered gene product sequence.  PRKAG2 syndrome is a rare, early-onset autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized by ventricular pre-excitation, supraventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac hypertrophy (PMID: 26729852; 32259713; 32646570). There is a debate about penetrance but there appears to be variable expressivity of the clinical phenotype which may be variant specific (PMID: 32646569; 12015471). PRKAG2 variants have been recognized mainly in the context of patients with non-sarcomeric familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (PMID: 26729852). The PRKAG2 gene encodes for the 5â Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), specifically for its Î³2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2). PRKAG2 pathogenic variants are suspected to modify the tri-dimensional structure of AMPK, altering its affinity for AMP and modifying the enzyme activity (PMID: 32259713; 28009297). Nearly all pathogenic variants are missense (PMID: 32259713; 32646569; 12015471; 28009297).  Blair et al. documented a TTA codon insertion in exon 5 in 2001 in a family affected by severe early onset cardiomyopathy and multiple sudden deaths in early adult life (PMID: 11371514). The variant is in a highly conserved region and co-segregated with disease. This has not been reported again on ClinVar.  Lopez-Sainz A et al reported one frameshift and one intronic variant (the rest missense) in their multi-centre retrospective study of 90 PRKAG2 variant carriers in 2020 (PMID: 32646569). However, the significance of truncating variants remains uncertain with insufficient evidence to support loss of function as a mechanism of disease. ClinGen found no evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a mechanism (https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/HGNC:9386).  Two commonly reported variants are C.905G>A (p.Arg302Gln) and c.1463A>T (p.Asn488Ile). Lopez-Sainz A et al found they were present in 44% of the patients included in the cohort (PMID: 32646569).",AD
KCNQ1,"Biallelic pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 cause JLNS due to absent gene product level or altered gene product sequence. Both homozygous and compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 have been reported in JLNS. Nonsense, frameshift, splice site, whole exon deletions and missense variants have been reported as pathogenic. Bhuiyan and Wilde (PMID: 23591039) compared two groups of patients with homozygous variants in KCNQ1. Those patients where there was residual IKs (slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel/current) even as little as 10%, had QT prolongation but no hearing loss (autosomal recessive LQTS), whereas those patients with complete absence of IKs had both QT prolongation and hearing loss (JLNS).  They concluded that homozygous or compound heterozygous nonsense, frameshift or exon skipping variants resulting in 100% loss of IKs would result in JLNS. In addition, biallelic missense mutations that lead to a protein product that does not traffic to the cell membrane (or is subject to nonsense mediated decay) will lead to JLNS.Note: heterozygous variants in KCNQ1 lead to dominant LQTS.

SLC22A5,"Variants in SLC22A5 cause autosomal recessive primary systemic carnitine deficiency (PSCD), a syndrome characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, liver dysfunction, hypotonia and cardiomyopathy (PMID 26190315).  Homozygote or compound heterozygote variants have been identified in unexplained sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest cases without overt extra-cardiac manifestations (PMIDs: 31472821, 3009296). Furthermore, a short QT interval has been demonstrated in a carnitine deficient mouse model (31472821) as well as in patients with PSCD (31472821, 3009296). Importantly, however, the QT interval in these patients returns to normal with carnitine supplementation treatment.   Information on ClinGen gene-disease validity conclusion: the ClinGen GCEP  conclude that PSCD is a metabolic and reversible SQTS-mimic. While there is no robust evidence of a relationship between SLC22A5 and true SQTS [ClinGen âdisputedâ classification], there is ""definitive"" evidence for a relationship between SLC22A5 and PSCD which may justify testing in individuals being investigated for possible SQTS.

MYH7,"MYH7 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence leading to an increase in sarcomere force generation. Variants produce an abnormal activated protein that incorporates into the sarcomere as a âpoison peptideâ. Variants can either directly affect motor function or can impact on myosin ""interacting head motif"" and therefore impair inactivation kinetics. There is currently no evidence to support haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, typified by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. 
Most pathogenic variants are missense. There are some inframe deletions reported. A frameshift variant has been identified in 3.3% of Egyptian HCM patients. It is predicted to result in a premature termination codon downstream of the last exon-exon junction of the gene that is expected to escape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). (PMID: 34460321). MYH7 loss of function (LoF) variants are very rare and their contribution to inherited cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood. Notably in a recent study of LVNC, MYH7 truncating variants, generally considered non-pathogenic for cardiomyopathies, were 20-fold enriched in LVNC cases over controls (PMID: 33500567). While there is currently no evidence for a disease-causing role in the heterozygous state in HCM, compound heterozygosity of LoF variants along with missense variants can lead to extremely severe presentations, mimicking recessive inheritance. There is a clustering of HCM variants in the head region conferring a high probability of pathogenicity (amino acid residues 181-937). (PMID: 27247418; 27532257; 29300372; 30696458).

CALM1,"CALM1-related LQTS is caused by an altered gene product sequence. Reduction in the calcium dependent inactivation of the calcium channel CaV1.2 results in increased inward calcium channel current (ICaL) and repolarization delay. The disease mechanism is likely a dominant negative effect. The three CALM genes encode an identical 149aa protein, calmodulin. The CALM1 gene is located on chromosome 14, CALM2 on chromosome 2 and CALM3 on chromosome 19. Calmodulin protein is involved in many calcium-dependent intracellular processes.  All three CALM genes have been classified as Definitive for LQTS and Moderate for CPVT, certain variants are only associated with one or other phenotype, whereas others are associated with a mixed or variable phenotypes.  All variants with evidence of pathogenicity identified in the CALM genes are missense: at least 35 distinct missense variants have been identified and reported in the International Calmodulinopathy Registry including 11 (31%) in CALM1, 16 (46%) in CALM2, and 8 (23%) in CALM3. The majority of variants across the CALM genes affect amino acid residues in the EF-hand Ca2+ binding loop III and IV. Some variants have additional evidence in that the same substitution has been seen in paralogous CALM genes, or that the same substitution has been seen in a related phenotype (LQTS). Most variants are unique, but 9 were present in more than one index case and among these, three (p.Asn98Ser, p.Asp130Gly, and p.Phe142Leu, identified in 10, 5, and 4 families, respectively.) appear to be recurrent. While variants p.Asp130Gly and p.Phe142Leu have always been reported as associated with the LQTS phenotype, the variant p.Asn98Ser has phenotypic variability, including LQTS, CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden death. The majority of CALM variants are de novo. Pathogenic variants in the CALM genes have been associated with: presentation in infancy or early childhood (up to 5 years); marked sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block and QT prolongation; and, predominantly with CALM1 variants, a mild-to-severe neurological impairment, including seizures, development delay, motor and/or cognitive disability. The phenotype most frequently shown by patients with CALM variants is LQTS, but some patients display other phenotypes including CPVT, idiopathic VF and sudden unexplained death. Some variants have been associated with both LQTS and CPVT, however Crotti et al (PMID: 31170290) report that ""despite the relatively small numbers of cases, a significant association (Pâ=â0.001) was observed between location of mutation and phenotype (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

TNNT2,"TNNT2 pathogenic variants cause HCM through altered gene product sequence. Troponin T is a regulatory protein found in striated muscles that forms a complex with troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC) that, together with tropomyosin (TM), is required for Ca2+ dependent regulation of muscle contraction.  The mechanism appears to be dominant negative rather than haploinsufficiency. The majority of pathogenic variants are missense. A functional study of a splice variant associated with HCM concluded that the resulting truncated protein does not function as a ânull protein, but rather as a dominant-negative leading to reduction in the level of calcium activated force productionâ (PMID: 8958207). Gangadharan et al suggest the primary reason by which TNNT2 variants between residues 92 and 144 cause cardiomyopathy is by changing the affinity of TnT for Tm within the N terminal part of Troponin T (PMID: 28973951). TNNT2 variants account for <5% of HCM cases (NBK1768; 12860912) Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterised by incomplete penetrance (PMID: 32731933).<br/ Homozygous TNNT2 variants causing HCM are rare and have been reported to be associated with more severe disease (PMID 30578328; 10965086; 11034944). Piroddi et al investigated a patient with severe, early onset HCM with a homozygous K280N variant. There was no family information available, however the authors demonstrated that it resulted in 100% mutant cTnT with no evidence of haploinsufficiency and suggested this supports the idea of a gene doseâdependent effect of HCM variants on the severity of the phenotype (PMID 30578328). Experts commented that variants seen in TNNT2 in severe/early onset disease were more likely to be de novo in origin. Nearly all pathogenic variants are missense (PMID: 12707239; 22144547; 25611685). However, there are a few reports of inframe deletions, nonsense variants in the final exon which likely escape nonsense mediated decay and splice donor variants (PMID: 8958207; 12707239; 22144547; 25611685). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/43673/;  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/177636/  Walsh et al found non truncating variants in the TNNT2 gene to be significantly enriched in HCM cases, odds ratio 11.4 (8.5 â 15.2).

PTPN11,"PTPN11-related Noonan syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with variable expressivity. Pulmonary stenosis is the most common cardiac manifestation. The penetrance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in PTPN11-related Noonan syndrome has been reported as 20-30%. There is no definite evidence of PTPN11 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of Noonan syndrome, but the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. This suggests that cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, and PTPN11 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. PTPN11 variants are the most common cause of Noonan syndrome, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. The mechanism is likely gain of function due to missense variants (particularly variants disrupting interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains), leading to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. There are at least two reports of Noonan syndrome due to single-residue in-frame deletions in PTPN11. There are reports of structural duplications including PTPN11 causing Noonan syndrome, but all patients reported to date have had a relatively non-specific phenotype and large duplications encompassing other genes. It is therefore not clear whether gene duplication specifically causes Noonan syndrome. Allelic disorders include Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML, previously known as LEOPARD syndrome), caused by dominant-negative PTPN11 variants, and metachondromatosis, caused by loss-of-function PTPN11 variants.",AD
RAF1,"RAF1 variants are responsible for ~5% of Noonan syndrome cases. RAF1-related Noonan syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. The mechanism is likely RAF1 gain of function, due to missense variants leading to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. 
The penetrance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is higher in patients with RAF1 variants, compared to other forms of Noonan syndrome. There is no definite evidence of RAF1 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of Noonan syndrome, but RAF1 variants have been identified in multiple patients who were being investigated for HCM, indicating that the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. Since cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, RAF1 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. There is evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation, with variants in the CR2 domain of RAF1 more likely to be associated with HCM. There is a further mutational hotspot in the kinase domain of CR3, but pathogenic variants have also been identified outside these hotspots. There are reports of patients with chromosomal duplications including RAF1, but their phenotype is relatively non-specific and there is no definitive evidence that whole-gene duplications cause Noonan syndrome.

There is no definite evidence of RIT1 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of Noonan syndrome, but the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. This suggests that cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, and RIT1 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. The mechanism is likely RIT1 gain of function, due to missense variants leading to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. The precise mechanism by which missense variants lead to gain of function remains unclear. There is clustering of variants, particularly in the switch II region.",AD
RYR2,"RYR2 is associated with CPVT with autosomal dominant inheritance. The allelic requirement for pathogenicity is monoallelic autosomal, and the disease is typified by incomplete penetrance. Disease is due to an altered gene product sequence.   The first reports of RYR2 variants in CPVT included numerous examples of de novo inheritance (Priori et al, 2001, PMID:11208676; Priori et al, 2002, PMID:12093772), although RYR2 missense variants often occur through familial autosomal dominant inheritance.  The predicted functional consequence of RYR2 pathogenic variants is altered gene product sequence. The majority of causative RYR2 variants in CPVT patients are heterozygous missense variants which are detected in up to 60% of cases with a definitive CPVT diagnosis (Kapplinger et al, 2018, PMID:29453246) and act through a gain-of-function mechanism. Pathogenic variants in CPVT cases tend to be clustered in a number of regions in the RYR2 gene/protein: -  Original exon hotspots: 3â15, 44â50, 83â90 and 93â105 (George et al, 2007, PMID:17081562). -  Updated exon hotspots: 3, 8, 14, 43, 47â49, 81, 83, 88â90, 93, 95, 97â101, 103, 105 (Kapplinger et al, 2018, PMID:29453246). -  Hotspots based on unsupervised clustering algorithm (not restricted to exon boundaries): amino acid residues 2138â2538, 3935â4196 and 4721â4959 (Walsh et al, 2019, PMID:30696458).  Rare cases of whole exon deletions of RYR2 exon 3 have been described that can lead to a CPVT and/or left ventricular non-compaction phenotype (Bhuiyan et al, 2007, PMID:17875969; Marjamaa et al, 2009, PMID:19216760; Szentpali et al, 2013, PMID:23479668; Onho et al, 2014, PMID:24394973; Campbell et al, 2015, PMID:26018045; Mazzarotto et al, 2021, PMID:33500567).

PTPN11,"
Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML, previously known as LEOPARD syndrome) is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Missense variants in PTPN11 are responsible for the majority of cases. Rare cases have been attributed to variants in RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K1.
There is no definite evidence of PTPN11 variants causing isolated cardiac disease without other features of NSML, but the syndromic phenotype can be subtle and may be underdiagnosed. This suggests that cardiac involvement can be the initial presentation in some cases, and PTPN11 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HCM. PTPN11 variants associated with NSML are clustered in the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain and have been shown to inhibit phosphatase activity. Since null variants have not been associated with the NSML phenotype, it has been suggested that NSML is caused by a dominant-negative effect rather than simple loss of function, possibly due to altered interaction between PTPN11 and binding partners. Allelic disorders include Noonan syndrome, caused by gain-of-function variants in PTPN11, and metachondromatosis, caused by loss-of-function PTPN11 variants.",AD
ABCC9,"ABCC9 pathogenic variants cause Cantu Syndrome (CS) through altered gene product sequence. The mechanism is likely gain of function (NBK246980; PMID: 22610116; PMID: 31175705; PMID:Â 30089727).Harakalova et al showed that variants in ABCC9 reduce the ATP-mediated potassium channel inhibition, resulting in channel opening (PMID: 22610116). Pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in the clinical manifestations remain poorly understood. Cantu syndrome is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, distinctive facial features, osteochondrodysplasia and cardiac defects. The cardiac manifestations include patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomegaly, hypertrophy and pericardial effusion. It does not present with isolated LVH. All participants in the Cantu registry who harboured a pathogenic missense variant have at least some features in keeping with Cantu syndrome, even if mild. There is however significant variability in phenotype even amongst family members with the same variant (PMID:Â 33529173) and no clear genotype phenotype correlation (PMID: 31828977). Inheritance is autosomal dominant characterized by variable expressivity. De novo variants are common, Grange et al found only 16/74 (22%) patients had inherited the ABCC9 variant from an affected parent (PMID: 31828977). It is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in ABCC9 (or less commonly variants in KCNJ8). A review of 74 patients in the International Registry for Cantu syndrome in 2019 found 28 distinct variants (97% were in ABCC9). All were simple missense apart from one insertion deletion involving 2 nucleotides (c.3055_3,056 del ins GA). Missense variants were located throughout the protein, however a majority (68%) clustered around transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2). Variants at p.Arg1154 (identified in 24 subjects, 33%) and p.Arg1116 (identified in 11 subjects, 15%), were most commonly observed (PMID: 31828977). Zhang et al 2021 showed that R1154Q variants in genetically modified mice might result in an effective mixed loss/gain of function phenotype, potentially explaining the diverse disease features in patients with CS. However, due to its extreme rarity, the mechanisms resulting in the clinical manifestations of CS remain to be fully elucidated (PMID:Â 33529173; PMID:Â 34453476).

CRYAB,"CRYAB-related alpha-crystallinopathy is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with age-related penetrance. The mechanism is likely altered gene product of CRYAB due to either (1) missense variants or (2) truncating variants in the 3â region which are predicted to escape NMD. A dominant-negative mechanism has been suggested. Variants in CRYAB have been variably associated with dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy, as well as cases with other systemic features of crystallinopathy (cataract, skeletal myopathy) without cardiac involvement. Evidence for dosage sensitivity is limited. Homozygous truncating variants predicted to cause NMD have been associated with autosomal recessive congenital/early-onset cataracts and myopathy with respiratory involvement in early childhood, and the heterozygous parents of probands are reported as being healthy.

FXN,"FXN-related Friedreich ataxia is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Heterozygous carriers of FXN expansions or other pathogenic variants have not been reported to develop symptoms. Homozygous expansion of the GAA triplet repeat in exon 1 of FXN is responsible for the majority of cases (95-98%). There is an inverse correlation between the size of the expansion and age of onset (particularly the size of the shorter allele). Anticipation is not observed as the disorder follows autosomal recessive inheritance. The remaining cases are due to compound heterozygosity for a GAA expansion and a sequence variant (truncating, splice-site, or missense) or structural variant (single-/multi-exon or whole-gene deletion). There is evidence that compound heterozygosity is associated with earlier onset of symptoms than homozygosity for the GAA triplet repeat expansion, but cardiomyopathy is more common in patients with a homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion. The mechanism is likely loss of function of FXN due to transcriptional silencing (in the case of the GAA triplet repeat), absent/reduced gene product (truncating variants, structural variants), or missense variants causing loss of function.

GAA,"Pompe disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition, caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in GAA. The mechanism of disease is loss of function of acid alpha-glucosidase, resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation. There are currently over 900 variants in the Pompe variant database (N.B. this includes all known variants, regardless of pathogenicity). Multiple classes of variant have been shown to cause Pompe disease, including loss-of-function variants, missense variants, splice-site variants, 5â UTR variants, intronic variants, and structural variants. There is a genotype-phenotype correlation, with bi-allelic loss of function expected to result in a severe phenotype (infantile-onset Pompe disease), while patients with residual enzymatic activity develop late-onset Pompe disease. Cardiac involvement is a classical feature of infantile-onset Pompe disease, but has also been reported in the late-onset form. Curation  done on , 27.03.2021 Expert panel review pending.",AR
MYO6,"There is evidence from multiple reports that loss-of-function and missense variants in MYO6 are associated with autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is associated with congenital hearing loss, suggesting a dose-dependent mechanism. The evidence for cardiac involvement is limited. Mohiddin et al. (2004, PMID: 15060111) reported a family with autosomal dominant hearing loss who were initially ascertained due to the proband presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Linkage studies implicated the region containing MYO6, and a missense variant was identified (p.His246Arg) and segregated with disease (with the exception of one individual who was negative for the variant but described as a âdouble phenocopyâ). QT prolongation was observed in 5 out of 12 carriers of the variant. Evidence of LV hypertrophy was observed in 4 out of 11 carriers who underwent echocardiogram. No specific mechanism of disease causation was suggested.
Studies in transgenic mouse models have suggested a link with cardiac hypertrophy, but only in biallelic knockout mice. In summary, there is a single report linking the p.His246Arg variant in MYO6 with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype exhibiting incomplete penetrance (Mohiddin et al. 2004, PMID: 15060111). The authors note that they were unable to definitively rule out an alternative cause for the cardiac phenotype in the family. This phenotype has not been observed in other families presenting with MYO6-related hearing loss (e.g., Sanggaard et al. 2008, PMID: 18348273; Miyagawa et al. 2015, PMID: 25999546), including patients with homozygous loss-of-function or missense variants (Ahmed et al. 2003, PMID: 12687499).

SLC25A4,"Pathogenic variants in SLC25A4 cause mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome through altered gene product sequence or absent gene product level. SLC25A4 encodes AAC1 (also known as ANT1), an ADP/ATP carrier isoform expressed at high levels in the skeletal muscle, heart and brain. âPhenotypically,Â SCL25A4Â mutations manifest as progressive external ophthalmoplegia if transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and associated with multiple mtDNA deletions or as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle myopathy if transmitted in an autosomal recessive way and associated with mtDNA depletionâ (PMID:Â 30013777). SCL25A4 variants do not present with isolated LVH. Null recessive mutations cause a mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy phenotype that presents in childhood or early adulthood (mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12). It is suggested that transporter dysfunction causes insufficient adenine nucleotide availability for dATP synthesis and consequent imbalanced dNTP pools, leading to mtDNA depletion (PMID 27693233; 30013777). A small number of homozygous and compound heterozygous variants have been described including missense, frameshift and splice variants. There are 4 pathogenic submissions on ClinVar. All are predicted to cause loss of function (PMID:16155110; PMID:22187496; PMID:25732997). Thompson et al found that 3 previously reported recessive variants resulted in <1% transport activity compared to wild-type (PMID 27693233).

(2004, PMID: 15060111) reported a family with autosomal dominant hearing loss who were initially ascertained due to the proband presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Linkage studies implicated the region containing MYO6, and a missense variant was identified (p.His246Arg) and segregated with disease (with the exception of one individual who was negative for the variant but described as a âdouble phenocopyâ). QT prolongation was observed in 5 out of 12 carriers of the variant. Evidence of LV hypertrophy was observed in 4 out of 11 carriers who underwent echocardiogram. No specific mechanism of disease causation was suggested.
Studies in transgenic mouse models have suggested a link with cardiac hypertrophy, but only in biallelic knockout mice. In summary, there is a single report linking the p.His246Arg variant in MYO6 with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype exhibiting incomplete penetrance (Mohiddin et al. 2004, PMID: 15060111). The authors note that they were unable to definitively rule out an alternative cause for the cardiac phenotype in the family. This phenotype has not been observed in other families presenting with MYO6-related hearing loss (e.g., Sanggaard et al. 2008, PMID: 18348273; Miyagawa et al. 2015, PMID: 25999546), including patients with homozygous loss-of-function or missense variants (Ahmed et al. 2003, PMID: 12687499).
